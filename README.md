# Yoga Store

Simple Ruby program made during the first week of the 9-week Codaisseur Academy.

Making this program was an exercise in getting to know loops and iteration in Ruby.

Assignment: create a program with products and a shopping cart. Requirements:
- Welcome the user by printing out a list of the different products.
- User should be able to select a product by its reference_number and it will be added to the shopping cart.
- Every time that user buys a new product, the current shopping cart should be printed out.
- Every time that user buys a new product, the program should ask if he/she wants to continue shopping or check out.
- If user decides to checkout, print out a bye-bye message.
